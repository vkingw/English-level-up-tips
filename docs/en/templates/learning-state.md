Primary file location:

## Goal
- Real context:

## Current Level and Baseline
- I can currently:
- Baseline sample:
- Latest score/feedback:

| Sample | Conditions | Location | Date | What it does not show yet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | | | | |

## Completed
- [date] task — output/evidence location — result/next step

## Errors, Risks, and Knowledge Gaps
| Error/risk | Evidence | Likely cause/confidence | Next treatment and stop condition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Methods That Worked

## Cross-session Recovery Prompt

```text
Below is my learning-state file. In no more than six bullets, restate the state version, goal, current evidence, main errors, boundaries, and next action. Flag conflicts or missing information; do not pretend to remember another chat or invent facts absent from the file. Design one exercise only for the “smallest next task”: let me answer first, then give feedback against the acceptance criteria. Do not provide a complete answer unless I ask. Finish with five paste-ready updates: completed, evidence, errors/risks, handover, next action.

An AI summary is not the source of truth. Resume from the file, saved work, sources, and version number; after a weekly review, update the [Weekly Review](weekly-review.md), [Evidence Chain](evidence-chain.md), and [90-Day Cycle Map](90-day-cycle.md) by their separate jobs instead of copying the same record.
